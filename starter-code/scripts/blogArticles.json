Nice lady, at the end of a conversation about being a fullstack JavaScript developer asks me if I am willing to move.</p><p><em>I would love to move down to Austin, Texas. The cost of living difference is like a huge pay bump! My motto is have gun, will travel</em></p><p>To which the recruiter replies "You are an Oregon liberal and you own a gun? That\'s great! I just bought a Colt Python!" My reaction:</p><p><img src="assets/img/blackadder-confused-look.gif" class="pull-right" > For the record, the image is something I found on the net and is not me, but of Blackadder.

So, without further ado, here are a few things I want to accomplish as a developer.</p><ul><li>Earn a PMP cert: Ok, this isn\'t a tech project per se, but It woul be nice to be able to actually have a project manager title</li><li>Twitterbot: I want to use either Python or Ruby/Rails to make a Twitterbot whose sole purpose is to output the local McMenamin\'s growler specials.</li><li>Make an AJAX-powered dynamic photo gallery webpage.</li><li>Mobile Phone book app. I don\'t know about everyone else, but I use an auto-record book in the car and track every drop of petrol that goes in it and every maintenence that it has done on it. My parents gave me that habbit, so I thought, why not produce an app for phones that does that?</li></ul>'

So nothing I can put on Github.</p><p>I think my favorite would hae to be my first job as an unoffical DBA for a tiny company in Newberg, OR, called PPM Technologies. I saved the company by bankruptcy by rescuing their database. They ran it from an Excel spreadsheet because the "free" option they had used was by then corrupted byeond repair.<p>But really, my recent and most favorite project was when I worked for a small company doing custom SAP implementations. I wrote a program for a client distillery that would move through the database and automate TTB reports. For those of you who have never heard of them, they are old holdover laws from prohibition. Every month, your booze-making company must tell our Federal govt. what they made, sold, destroyed and denatured and how much materials they made. And all the results must add up. I spent a lot of time talking with federal regulators to the point where we actually exchanged Christmas cards. I think my favorite part was explaining to my then-boss was how no, it was literally impossible to get a "seal of approval" from the government for our software.</p></p>Making a website for a great employment law lawyer named <a href="http://www.multistakeholderlaw.com">Krista Le Roux and her site MultiStakeHolder Law.</a> She likes to help people create employee-owned businesses. She said her dream "pro-bono" project was to create an employee-owned strip club in PDX.</p>'
